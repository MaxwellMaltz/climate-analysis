# Climate Analysis Toolkit

This is a set of python scripts designed to analyse climate datafiles. This whole directory is to be used as a practice set in conjunction with the DiRAC HPC-skills course.

If you're interested in collaborating, email me at m.maltz@sussex.ac.uk

To install a copy of the toolkit, go to a terminal and run:
git clone git@github.com:smangham/climate-analysis.git
